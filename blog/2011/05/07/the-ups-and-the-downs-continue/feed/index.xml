Hi John,

My RTW packing list has been quite good so far as there isn&#039;t anything that I&#039;ve immediately needed / missed, but there are a couple of things that I could have brought along - altitude pills, a lonely planet guide book (not the Footprint one I had), vaseline (sunburnt lips), sleeping shorts rather than relying on boxers... Its sundries mainly which I&#039;ve been able to pick up here quite easily. The only thing I wished I had, but couldn&#039;t find - decent quick drying socks. Nights here are cold and it&#039;s nigh on impossible to dry clothes, that includes the quick-drying boxers and towel! 

In terms of essentials, a familiar alarm clock (you have to wake at 5am so need to know you can wake), my spare camera battery (wish I&#039;d brought 2 spares) and jeans! Jeans are big, bulky, heavy, terrible in the wet but they make you feel &quot;normal&quot; amongst the travel clothes wearing holiday makers. On that subject, I do wish I&#039;d brought a some &quot;normal&quot; clothes though - I went with the cargo shorts &#038; shirts as they are more verstatile for me and more usable on treks, but it does make you stand out a little in towns. You can tell the holiday makers as they are all wearing these sorts of clothes and someone asked if I worked at Machu Picchu yesterday as I &quot;had a uniform&quot;. Still, clothes are cheap enough here so I&#039;ll grab a couple of t-shirts and jobs a good-un :)

In terms of things I shouldn&#039;t have brought - the big notepad (I&#039;ve got a smaller one instead), the 30l rucksack (it&#039;s great for the Inca Trail and presumably buses, but it&#039;s usless to carry around).

I hope your travels go well! It&#039;s nerve-wracking, but there are some great people around and whilst it&#039;s tough, it&#039;s fun as well. I just need to get the ratio of fun up!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Stefan,

I came across your site while researching what I would need to take for my own round the world trip that I am planning to start this year.. I see that you are about a week into your trip now.. any immediate thoughts about the stuff you&#039;ve taken - what is most essential, what you think you could have left behind, what you wish you had taken but didn&#039;t? It would be interesting to hear your opinion now, then again in a couple of months!

Hope you&#039;re doing well and experiencing many great things out there in world,

-John]]></description>
