It’s easy to see why I’m behind – I’ve been having too much fun to sit down and write about things! To catch myself back up, I figured I’d [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post is about possibly the finest week of my trip so far. It’s about finding a new love. It’s about meeting some amazing people. It’s about getting seduced by a way of life. It’s about potentially finding a new direction of career. It’s about nine days of near perfection. It’s also nigh on to be impossible to write about and convey just how great my time in Utila was but I'll try anyway!]]></description>

The sand is Volcanic so is a dirty grey rather than a crisp white and the whole town feels, well, cheap.
